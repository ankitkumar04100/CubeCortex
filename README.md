## Inspiration

The journey of **CubeCortex** started with a simple question:  
*"What if Kubernetes microservices could think for themselves?"*

Modern cloud-native apps rely on **Kubernetes** for orchestration, scaling, and fault tolerance. Yet, managing complex microservices at scale often requires **manual oversight**, frequent interventions, and deep DevOps expertise. Teams face challenges like:
- Detecting anomalies before outages occur.  
- Coordinating services across heterogeneous environments.  
- Managing autoscaling intelligently (not just CPU/memory triggers).  
- Ensuring resiliency when **unexpected spikes** or **security threats** hit.  

We drew inspiration from **the human brain** – where neurons (agents) work together, coordinate signals, and self-correct. Similarly, CubeCortex uses **AI agents as neurons** to intelligently orchestrate microservices in Kubernetes.  

---

## What it does

CubeCortex is an **AI-driven orchestration layer** for Kubernetes clusters that adds intelligence to microservices.  

Key functionalities:
- 🔍 **Smart Anomaly Detection** – Detects abnormal latency, request spikes, or unusual API call patterns.  
- 🧠 **AI Agents for Microservices** – Specialized agents (Recommendation, Fraud Detection, Chat Support) that interact with microservices.  
- 📊 **Self-healing Workflows** – Automatically restarts unhealthy pods, re-routes traffic, or scales replicas intelligently.  
- 🎯 **Context-aware Autoscaling** – Uses ML-based predictions instead of static resource thresholds.  
- 🔗 **Service Dependency Graph** – Visualizes and learns from interactions between microservices.  
- 🌐 **End-to-End Dashboard** – Unified view of health, recommendations, alerts, and AI insights.  

**Elevator Pitch (200 characters):**  
*"CubeCortex brings AI intelligence into Kubernetes microservices – enabling smarter scaling, anomaly detection, and self-healing clusters for cloud-native applications."*

## How we built it

CubeCortex is built as a **layered architecture**:

1. **Base Layer – Kubernetes (GKE)**  
   - Core cluster orchestrating microservices.  
   - We deployed Google’s **Online Boutique** as the base microservice application.  

2. **CubeCortex Agent Layer**  
   - AI agents built in **Python (FastAPI + PyTorch)** and **Node.js (Express)**.  
   - Agents run as independent microservices, deployed via Kubernetes manifests.  

3. **AI Models**  
   - Time-series forecasting for load prediction.  
   - Anomaly detection using autoencoders.  
   - Recommendation systems for service interactions.  

4. **Orchestration Middleware**  
   - Agents communicate through **gRPC + REST APIs**.  
   - Shared event bus using **Kafka / PubSub**.  

5. **Dashboard Layer**  
   - Built in **React + Tailwind + Chart.js**.  
   - Real-time metrics pulled from Prometheus + custom APIs.

## Challenges we ran into

- ⚡ **Complexity of Orchestration** – Making AI agents interact with Kubernetes events in real time required deep integration with **Kubernetes API Server**.  
- 📈 **Scaling ML Models** – Deploying ML inference in production without latency bottlenecks was challenging.  
- 🔒 **Security & Isolation** – Ensuring that AI agents don’t over-control or create cascading failures.  
- 🧩 **Data Availability** – Simulating realistic traffic to train models for anomaly detection and predictions.  
- ⏱️ **Hackathon Time Constraint** – Balancing feature scope vs stability in limited time.  

---

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Successfully created a **working AI-driven microservices orchestration system**.  
- Deployed multiple AI agents into GKE and proved interoperability.  
- Designed a **clean dashboard** that shows real-time cluster intelligence.  
- Learned to optimize ML models for **cloud-native deployment**.  
- Contributed reusable YAML + agent code that others can build on.  

---

## What we learned

- The power of **AI + Kubernetes** synergy in cloud-native apps.  
- How **event-driven agents** can replace manual DevOps intervention.  
- Best practices in deploying ML inference services at scale.  
- Importance of **observability (Prometheus, Grafana)** when debugging complex systems.  
- That innovation isn’t just about technology – but about **making clusters more human-friendly**.
